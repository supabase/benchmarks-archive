# GoTrue benchmark(Work in progress)

Updated and reproducible benchmark for GoTrue by using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [k6](https://k6.io).

## Setup

This whole setup will be handled by Nix.

Run `nix-shell`. This will provide an environment where all the dependencies are available.

```
nix-shell
